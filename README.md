# Vite + pnpm + TypeScript + React + css + react-icons + react-bootstrap + bootstrap

The rationals for using the above stack are as follow

- Vite: Much faster than Webpack. Has HMR during development which makes tasks much easier and interactive during development. Builds much faster
- pnpm: Parallel processing of build and installations.
- Typescript: Better for typechecking and avoid typing mistakes and has better support
- React: Quick and easy learning curve and I am doing this project to learn it
- css: I avoided using any libraries just so I can get my hands dirty on plain old css
- react-bootstrap + bootstrap: It has support to react hooks and it's easier to work with components than normal CSS
- react-icons: A ready made package that has a lot of icons. syntax is pretty interactive.
  Example: Go on this website: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/search/#q=edit and search for an icon. Say we select FaRegEdit
  The import is import { FaEdit } from "@react-icons/all-files/fa/FaEdit"; // after "all-files" add "fa/FaEdit".
